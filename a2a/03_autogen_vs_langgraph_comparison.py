"""
AutoGen vs LangGraph: A2A Communication Comparison
This file demonstrates the key differences between:
- AutoGen: True Agent-to-Agent communication
- LangGraph: Orchestrated workflow management

Setup for AutoGen:
1. pip install pyautogen
2. ollama pull llama3.2
3. ollama serve

Key Differences:
- AutoGen: Agents decide who to talk to and when
- LangGraph: Central orchestrator controls the flow
- AutoGen: Conversational, back-and-forth communication
- LangGraph: State-based, sequential processing
"""

# AutoGen Example (when installed)
AUTOGEN_EXAMPLE = '''
# AutoGen: Agents talk directly to each other
import autogen

researcher = AssistantAgent(name="researcher", ...)
writer = AssistantAgent(name="writer", ...)

# Agents have a conversation - they decide what to say and when
user_proxy.initiate_chat(researcher, message="Research AI trends")
# researcher talks to writer directly
# writer responds back to researcher
# They negotiate, debate, collaborate autonomously

# LangGraph Example (from our existing files)
LANGGRAPH_EXAMPLE = '''
# LangGraph: Central orchestrator controls flow
