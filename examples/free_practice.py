   - On-site gym membership subsidies
   - Weekly yoga classes
   - Walking meeting programs

2. **Mental Health Support**
   - Employee assistance programs
   - Stress management workshops
   - Mental health days

3. **Nutrition Programs**
   - Healthy snack options in break rooms
   - Nutrition education seminars
   - Subsidized healthy meal delivery

## Expected ROI
- 25% reduction in sick days
- 15% increase in employee satisfaction
- $500 per employee annual healthcare savings

## Implementation Timeline
- Month 1-2: Program design and vendor selection
- Month 3: Pilot program launch
- Month 4-6: Full rollout and evaluation"""

I'm a mock LLM designed for learning LangChain concepts without API costs. In a real application, this would be replaced with ChatOpenAI() and provide much more sophisticated responses.

This demonstrates how LangChain chains work:
1. Your input ‚Üí Prompt formatting
2. Prompt ‚Üí LLM processing  
3. LLM response ‚Üí Output parsing
4. Final result ‚Üí Your application

To use real AI, simply replace FreeLLM() with ChatOpenAI() and add your API key!"""
